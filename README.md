portable-rust-guide
-------------------
  
A guide to creating a portable installation of rust.  This allows you to keep all the files associated with the rust programming language on a normal USB drive(with a little bit of configuration), so that you can program using the language on any computer(currently only tested with windows, batch scripts provided obviously only work on 64 bit windows)  
  
1. Find a suitable USB thumbdrive
  + For our purposes you'll want decent read/write speeds
  + And at least a few GB
2. Formatting
